Return to Work (RTW) Analytics Project 🏥📊

🎯 Overview
This end-to-end analytics project simulates a workers' compensation Return to Work (RTW) program analysis for an insurance company. The project demonstrates the complete data analytics lifecycle—from 
data generation and cleaning through SQL analysis to interactive Power BI dashboards.Business Goal: Analyze workers' compensation claims to identify cost drivers, optimize RTW outcomes, improve billing efficiency,
and support strategic decision-making in insurance operations.

💡 Inspiration
This project was inspired by 4 months of shadowing a strategic expert at Gallagher Bassett, a leading third-party claims administrator. During this experience, I gained firsthand exposure to:

Workers' compensation claim management processes
Strategic analysis of RTW programs
Insurance industry KPIs and business intelligence
The critical role of data analytics in risk management

This shadowing opportunity was transformational—it sparked my passion for data analytics and led me to pursue a degree in Analytics. 
This project represents my attempt to apply those real-world insights to a comprehensive technical demonstration.
Special thanks to the Team Manager and Strategic Expert at Gallagher Bassett for this invaluable learning opportunity.

💎 Key Insights
📈 Business Findings

Average Claim Cost: $40,680 per claim
RTW Success Rate: 48% achieve Full RTW status
Primary Cost Driver: Medical expenses (45% of total costs)
Average Days Off Work: 46 days
Payment Delays: 30% of invoices delayed beyond 28 days
High-Risk Injury Types: Musculoskeletal injuries result in longest recovery times

Policy Performance: "Early Intervention" policy shows 22% faster payment processing

🎯 Strategic Recommendations

Early Intervention Programs: Focus on musculoskeletal claims to reduce days off work
Cost Management: Negotiate rates with high-volume service providers
Billing Optimization: Implement automated payment tracking for "Standard Policy" claims
RTW Support: Increase support for partial RTW cases to improve full recovery rates
